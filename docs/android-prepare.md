## Change Icons and Splash screens

Icons means that the image represents your application, while the splash screens is the image that shows when you open the application.

In essence you just change the image in the `/resources/android` folder.

Itâ€™s great that Ionic offers a tool for creating icons and splash screens automatically.

1. Install cordova-res IF not installed yet by run `npm i -g cordova-res`

2. Replace `/resources/icon.png` and `/resources/splash.png` by your image.

3. Run `ionic cordova resources android` create image assets

4. Run `cordova prepare android` update image assets to Android platform
